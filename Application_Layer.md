What is the Application Layer?

In a classic 3-tier architecture:

Presentation Layer – UI/UX (e.g., web frontend using HTML/JS)

Application Layer (Logic Layer) – Core functionality, rules, processing

Data Layer – Database, storage, and data access

On application layer:

- Implement business rules

- Handle HTTP requests and responses

- Coordinate between frontend and backend

- Manage sessions, authentication, and permissions

- Perform input validation and data processing
