<b>What is the Application Layer?</b>

In a classic 3-tier architecture:

Presentation Layer – UI/UX (e.g., web frontend using HTML/JS)

Application Layer (Logic Layer) – Core functionality, rules, processing

Data Layer – Database, storage, and data access

On application layer:

<ul> Implement business rules </ul>

<ul> Handle HTTP requests and responses </ul>

<ul> Coordinate between frontend and backend </ul>

<ul> Manage sessions, authentication, and permissions </ul>

<ul> Perform input validation and data processing </ul>
